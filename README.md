This is basically just a test. I just wiped Windows completely and instally Ubuntu Gnome and I wanted to quickly check out the new workflow.

I've been trying to learn node, mongoDB and react and will hopefully be creating a MERN app soon! It's pretty tough since I'm new so it's taking a while.

Eventually I want to create a working db and login system for this so I plan on making changes for a long time.
